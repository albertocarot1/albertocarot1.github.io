## Lessons Learned

### What Went Well ✓
- Hybrid search approach (combining semantic + keyword) significantly improved retrieval accuracy
- Chunking strategy with 512-token overlap prevented context loss
- RAGAS evaluation framework helped objectively measure improvements

### Challenges Faced ⚠
- Initial embeddings had poor domain coverage, required fine-tuning
- Latency spikes during peak hours required caching layer
- Hallucination rate was 8% initially, reduced to 2% with better prompting

### Key Takeaways 💡
- Always benchmark multiple retrieval strategies early
- Document versioning is critical - implement semantic versioning for docs
- Cost monitoring is essential - embeddings usage grew 3x faster than expected

### Future Improvements
- Implement agentic workflows for complex multi-step queries
- Add user feedback loop to continuously improve retrieval
- Explore open-source embedding models to reduce API costs

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Well ✓
- Quad-tracking rhythm guitars with different amp tones created massive wall of sound

- Vocal tracking took longer than expected due to ambitious melodies
- Mix translation issues between studio monitors and consumer devices

### Key Takeaways 💡
